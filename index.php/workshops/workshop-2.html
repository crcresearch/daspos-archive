<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> (i) Explore areas of commonality and difference, (ii) identify common metadata standards that could be designed to allow generic access and indexing of cross-disciplinary research data, and (iii) identify cross-disciplinary services that would support data preservation (e.g. software repositories).</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> A discussion framework similar to that of Workshop 1 will be developed and will also be used to conduct individual or small group discussions with targeted colleagues not available for the workshop (e.g. the research staff involved in archiving the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II).</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Provide extensive information about preservation efforts in other disciplines.</p>

<h3 class="d-semi-bold stats"><a href="../../images/workshops/workshop_two/presentations/DASPOS_Strawn.pdf">Workshop Presentation <span class="modifier">PDF</span></a></h3>
<p style="clear: both;">Dr. George O. Strawn is the Director of the National Coordination Office (NCO) for the Federal government’s multiagency Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program. He also serves as the Co-Chair of the NITRD Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council.

<h3 class="d-semi-bold stats"><a href="../../images/workshops/workshop_two/presentations/DASPOS_Moore.pdf">Workshop Presentation <span class="modifier">PDF</span></a></h3>
<p style="clear: both;">Reagan Moore is the Director of the Data Intensive Cyber Environments Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, professor in the School of Information and Library Science, and Chief Scientist at the Renaissance Computing Institute. Moore coordinates research efforts in development of policy-based data management systems that are used to support data grids, digital libraries, processing pipelines and persistent archives. Moore is the co-principal investigator for the development of the integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS). The iRODS technology automates the application of management policies, automates validation of assessment criteria, and minimizes the labor required to manage massive distributed data collections. The iRODS software is available as an open source distribution at <a href="../../%e2%80%9chttp_/irods.diceresearch.html"> http://irods.diceresearch.org</a>. Moore has a B.S. in physics from the California Institute of Technology (1967), and a Ph.D. in plasma physics from the University of California, San Diego (1978).</p>
<h4 class="d-semi-bold no-bottom-margin">Policy-based Data Management Systems</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Modern data management systems are evolving from a focus on data management, to a focus on knowledge management. Traditionally preservation has managed authenticity, integrity, chain of custody and original arrangement. Now long term preservation requires the ability to re-create derived data products, and reproduce data driven research results. Policy-based systems capture the associated knowledge in procedures/workflows that are controlled by computer actionable rules. The systems support registration and sharing of workflows, as well as sharing of input and output files. Preservation policies are enforced, administrative functions are automated, and assessment criteria are validated, enabling preservation at scale. Applications include genomics, high energy physics, astronomy, plant biology, seismology, medicine, oceanography, and climate.</p>

<h4 class="d-semi-bold">Talking Points:</h4>
<ul class="square" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
<li>The geosciences are extremely diverse in data production, management, and distribution processes, ranging from supercomputer simulations that generate petabytes of data to small-scale field teams using Excel spreadsheets.</li>
<li>Technology is an important factor in implementing data preservation solutions. Equally as important are establishing work routines, organizational processes, and plans/policies that facilitate data preservation as a critical activity.</li>
<li>Data access is the value proposition of data preservation. Preservation without adequate approaches to enable access are only addressing half of the challenge.</li>

<h4 class="d-semi-bold">Talking Points:</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Changes in technology and society are greatly affecting the types and quantities of potential data available for social-scientific analysis. Taken as a whole, the evidence base of social science is shifting. The changing nature, and ever increasing quantity of data, offers new opportunities for analysis, but strains our current infrastructure, methods and standards, for collecting, managing, securing and stewarding data.</p>
